/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict security model based on user ownership and role-based access.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The primary security principle is that users have complete control over their own data, but cannot access, list,
 * or modify the data of other users. Global, application-wide data (like lessons and dealerships) is made available
 * on a read-only basis to all authenticated users, with write operations restricted to prevent client-side tampering.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Each user has a profile document. This path is the root for all user-specific data.
 * - /users/{userId}/lessonLogs/{lessonLogId}: A user's private lesson history is nested under their document.
 * - /lessons/{lessonId}: A top-level collection for global lesson content, readable by all.
 * - /dealerships/{dealershipId}: A top-level collection for dealership information, readable by all.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Listing users is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Subcollection Ownership: By nesting `lessonLogs` under `/users/{userId}`, ownership is enforced by the path,
 *   making rules simple, secure, and performant for list queries.
 * - Read-Only Global Data: The `/lessons` and `/dealerships` collections are configured to be read-only for clients.
 *   This assumes that this data is managed by a trusted backend service or admin SDK, which is a secure pattern
 *   for foundational application data.
 * - Immutable Fields: Critical relational fields like a user's ID, role, and dealershipId are made immutable after
 *   creation to maintain system integrity and prevent users from escalating their own privileges.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The security model relies on path-based authorization for user-owned data. For example, a rule for
 * `/users/{userId}/lessonLogs/{lessonLogId}` simply checks `isOwner(userId)`, which is fast and efficient.
 * On creation, a `userId` field is required within the `lessonLog` document itself to ensure the data is consistent
 * with the path, preventing data misattribution.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private, user-specific data (`lessonLogs`) is structurally separated from public, global data (`lessons`).
 * This segregation is more secure and performant than using a single collection with flags, especially for
 * list operations, as it prevents accidental data leakage.
